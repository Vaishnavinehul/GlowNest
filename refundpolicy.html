        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Wrong Item Delivered</h2>

        <p style="color: black;"> 1. Do not open or use the wrong item. Keep the product in its original packaging, with all seals,
            labels, and
            tags intact. Using the product may complicate the return process.

            <br><br> 2. Document everything. Take clear photos or a video of the package and the item you received. Make
            sure the
            shipping label with the order number and your address is visible. This serves as proof for your claim.

            <br><br> 3. Find your order details. Locate your order confirmation email or log into your account on the
            GlowNest
            website to find your order number and the details of the item you originally purchased.
        </p>

        <h2>Item Damaged</h2>
        <b>GlowNest's policy is very specific for this situation:</b>

        <br><br>
        <p style="color: black;">"If you receive a product in a bad condition or if the packaging is tampered with, please refuse to accept
            the delivery and return the package to the delivery person. Contact us immediately, and we will ensure a
            brand new replacement is issued at no additional cost."

            <br><br> This is the most direct and effective way to resolve the issue according to their terms. By
            refusing the
            delivery, you are immediately signaling to both the courier and the company that the item is not in
            acceptable condition.

            <br><br> If You Already Accepted the Package
            Sometimes, damage isn't obvious until you've opened the package. If you've already accepted the delivery,
            don't worryâ€”you still have options.

            <br><br> <b>Do Not Use the Product:</b> Keep the item in its original packaging. Do not attempt to use or
            repair it, as this
            may void your ability to get a replacement or refund.

            <br><br> <b>Document the Damage:</b> Take clear, well-lit photos and videos of the damaged item. Be sure to
            also photograph
            the packaging, as this can help prove that the damage occurred during shipping.

            <br><br> <b>Find Your Order Details:</b> Locate your order confirmation email or log into your GlowNest
            account to find your
            order number.
